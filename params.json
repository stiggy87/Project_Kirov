{"tagline":"Autonomous Blimp/Zeppelin for Sparkfun AVC","body":"### Welcome to Project Kirov\r\nThis is a project for the Sparkfun Autonomous Vehicle Competition based in Boulder, CO. The goal of this project is to have a fully autonomous blimp using the Zedboard (www.zedboard.org). Fill free to check out the data we have. We will continually add documents, code, schematic/board layouts to the repo. For now, only contributors are allowed to do pull requests. This is because the project is currently being developed and any other forks/pulls could interfere with our standards of practices. The good news is, once the project is completed we will open it up for everyone! Follow our Trello at: https://trello.com/b/uMJCYQJK\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates  -- REMOVE ME\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick? -- REMOVE ME\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Team Members\r\nTeam Lead: Steve G (@stiggy87)\r\n\r\nMembers: Nik Cimino (@ncimino), Datalink","note":"Don't delete this file!
