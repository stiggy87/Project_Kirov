The goal of this project is to have a fully autonomous blimp using the Zedboard (www.zedboard.org). Fill free to check out the data we have. We will continually add documents, code, schematic/board layouts to the repo. For now, only contributors are allowed to do pull requests. This is because the project is currently being developed and any other forks/pulls could interfere with our standards of practices. The good news is, once the project is completed we will open it up for everyone! Follow our Trello at: https://trello.com/b/uMJCYQJK\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n### Where did Project Kirov come from?\r\nThe concept of Kirov came years ago when Renesas (www.renesas.com) hosted a contest with their microcontroller RX62N development board. The idea was to do a proof-of-concept autonomous blimp/zeppelin with video capabilities. Generally, the applications for the project ranged from military to civilian search and rescue purposes. Since the project fell through due to not qualifying for later phases in the contest and it was shelved until further notice.\r\n\r\nSince the contest, Xilinx Inc. (www.xilinx.com) has released the Zynq-7000 series (www.xilinx.com/zynq). This chip is the combination of an ARM Cortex-A9 with an FPGA with a full range of processing applications and seemed like the perfect fit to resurrect the project.\r\n\r\n### What is/are the goal/s of the project?\r\nHobbyists (not affiliated with groups like FIRST) have all the basic/same design for autonomous vehicles. A lot, if not all, contain a 1Hz GPS module, an Arduino Pro, and a few IR/sonar sensors. For the past few years, watching the AVC has shown stagnation in innovation and expansion into unfamiliar territories. This project is aimed to fixing that.\r\n\r\nHere are few of the major goals that we are trying to strive towards:\r\n* Being the first team to use an ARM+FPGA SoC device.\r\n* Being the first team to use a blimp design\r\n* To have the system be modular and be able to easily transplant from Blimp to RC car with little effort\r\n\r\n### What GPS Chip you using?\r\nThe initial GPS subsystem will be utilizing a San Jose Navigation 5Hz GPS sold by Sparkfun Electronics (www.sparkfun.com). Generally, GPS has induced error, which this GPS can correct to an extent. It uses UART for communication and supports warm-startup. Since Zynq has built-in UART to the ARM processor, this seems perfect to send to ARM for processing.\r\n\r\n### What is the propulsion of the blimp?\r\nThe propulsion subsystem is going to be high CFM fans with variable RPM capabilities. Since the vehicle is a blimp, fans will be used to keep it at a specific low altitude, as well drive it forward. Each fan will have a feedback signal to tell the Zedboard of conditions. The obvious solution looks to be using FPGA fabric to control these fans and let the ARM dictate thrust and direction from GPS coordinates. Since the blimp research was shelved to focus on subsystems, this is no finalized.\r\n\r\n### How are you going to make it doesn't run into anything?\r\nAir collisions for a blimp are usually a death sentence to the device and cost. To avoid poles, trees, buildings, cars, etc. the blimp will be equipped with a few sonar sensors. These sensors will most likely go to a central microcontroller for ADC and then send a digital signal to the Zedboard. Since collisions must be avoided at all costs, there will be no specific IRQ interrupt to the Zynq chip, but instead go straight to the FPGA fabric and adjust inputs to the motors directions/thrust as necessary while maintaining its course.\r\n\r\n### Is this going to do any video streaming?\r\nOne of the systems that Zynq has done well to demonstrate is video streaming capabilities. Utilizing the FPGA fabric for processing and then send the data to ARM for distribution via WiFi/RC. Since the ARM can support being a web server, by designing an ad-hoc network, users at events that are within range could theoretically connect using their smartphones and see what the blimp sees. This is an optional subsystem and might not make the final design due to complexity.\r\n\r\n### Are there any other features of the project that can end up being made?\r\nOther subsystems that are being considered are:\r\n* WiFi/Bluetooth control of the blimp. This allows anyone who is paired with it to fly it.\r\n* Basestation feedback. This was an original subsystem to the original concept, but has been removed due to complexity in radio frequency laws and basestation building/design. The idea was to have everything transfer over the 900MHz frequency to a central basestation and let a user control it and add waypoint commands as well receive feedback via video.\r\n* 24/7 flight. The original concept was to have a battery pack designed to run at night, and during the day have solar panels covering the blimp to charge the battery and power the systems. This is not feasible due to costs.\r\n\r\nIt is welcomed, once the project is done, that others contribute to the project by adding subsystems!\r\n\r\n## Team Members\r\n### Team Lead\r\nSteve G (@stiggy87)\r\n\r\n### Team Members\r\nNik Cimino (@ncimino)\r\n\r\nDatalink","tagline":"Autonomous Blimp/Zeppelin for Sparkfun AVC"}
